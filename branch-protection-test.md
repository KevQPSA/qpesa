# QPESA-8: Branch Protection Test

This file tests the newly implemented branch protection rules.

## Protection Rules Applied

### Main Branch:
- âœ… 2 required reviewers
- âœ… Code owner reviews required (@KevQPSA)
- âœ… Status checks must pass
- âœ… Linear history enforced
- âœ… No force pushes allowed

### Develop Branch:
- âœ… 1 required reviewer
- âœ… Status checks must pass
- âœ… No force pushes allowed

## Expected Behavior

When this PR is created:
1. Cannot merge without required approvals
2. Status checks must pass before merge
3. Code owner (@KevQPSA) must approve for main branch
4. Direct pushes to main/develop branches are blocked

## Test Results

This branch protection implementation ensures:
- **Code Quality**: All changes reviewed before merge
- **Security**: No unauthorized changes to protected branches
- **Compliance**: Audit trail for all changes
- **Stability**: Status checks prevent broken code deployment
